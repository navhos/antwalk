Antwalk:
Build Instructions:
- simply run the executable jar file to launch the program. Program has already been built.
- If you wish to build program individually:
- - javac ant.java walk.java UI.java
    java UI
- - OR | javac *.java
         jar cvfe Antwalk.jar UI *.class

Verification process:
Ran simulation for n=100 runs multiple times, and saw mean time converge to a value of around 10.
Repeated this process for n=1000.

Program features:
Returns mean time that ant takes.
Returns stddev of time.

Future directions:
Add a feature to add an epsilon value so that program is run n=x times such that it converges to a value which has
a difference of epsilon between multiple runs of the program.

Additional Details:
Classes/Objects:

-ant.java - the ant object.
Describes position of the ant, and steps taken.
Simulates ant movement by picking x,y, or z axis uniformly, and moves ant along the randomly selected axis.
Ant always starts at origin - to add in further randomness, initial position of ant could also be randomized.

-walk.java - the walk object
Simulates the ants path.
Creating a new random generator seed for each run, keeps ant moving till [1,1,1] is reached. Stores runtime of each run.
Calculates mean and standard deviation.

-UI.java - The GUI of the program.
